**Overview:**

Understanding what drives online shoppers is crucial in todayâ€™s e-commerce landscape. This project applies the CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) algorithm to identify and analyze the most important factors influencing consumer purchasing decisions. We combine CHAID with other machine learning models to uncover patterns and predict user behavior for smarter marketing and a more personalized shopping experience.


**Features:**

- Analyze customer demographics, browsing behavior, and purchase history
- Identify key factors influencing buying decisions using CHAID
- Segment customers into distinct behavioral groups
- Classify and predict consumer behavior using:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- ID3 Decision Trees
- Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
- XGBoost
- Clustering Techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Generate actionable insights for:
- Targeted marketing
- Personalized recommendations
- Optimized product placements


**Tech Stacks:**

Languages: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost
Algorithmic Techniques: CHAID, SVM, ID3, GBDT, XGBoost, Clustering
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

**Datasets:**

The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics
- Browsing and session behavior
- Purchase history
- Product preference metadata
  (Dataset source to be specified or uploaded in the data/ folder)
